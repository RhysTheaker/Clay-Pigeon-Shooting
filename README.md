# Clay Pigeon Shooting
This Clay Pigeon Shooting game is a very similar concept to 'Duck Hunt'; the well known light gun shooter video game developed in 1984 by the people at Nintendo for the historic Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The nostalgia of games like Duck Hunt, and other similar one-person-shooters inspired the creation of this Clay Pigeon Shooter.

## How To Play

* The player must attempt to hit 10 clay pigeons.
* The player only gets **one** shot per pigeon (so make sure your aim in on point!). If the player misses the pigeon then he/she will no longer be able to hit the pigeon until the next is released.
* The clay pigeons are released one at a time. Only when the pigeon has either been successfully shot **or** the pigeon manages to escape from the shooting range (i.e. collide with the edge of the container) will the next pigeon be released.
* Successfully hitting the pigeon will gain the player 30 points
* If the player misses the pigeon, he/she will be deducted 10 points (scores will go negative if you have a terrible aim!)
* The simple aim of the game is to hit as many pigeons as possible!
