# Sparta-Game-Project
This project involved a week long task of producing a simple browser based game using the fundamentals of programming: HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The minimum requirements of the final product were as follows. The game must have a win/lose condition and further display either a final score or win/lose message after every iteration of the game being played. In addition, there should be instructions on how to play the game, and lastly, it must be hosted online.
